However, its computational complexity is very high. In this paper, we propose three tools to enhance the WBCT coding scheme, in particular, on reducing its computational complexity. First, we propose short-length 2-D filters for directional transform. Second, the directional transform is applied to only a few selected subbands and the selection is done by a mean-shift-based decision procedure. Third, we fine-tune the context tables used by the arithmetic coder in WBCT coding to improve coding efficiency and to reduce computation. Simulations show that, at comparable coded image quality, the proposed scheme saves over 92% computing time of the original WBCT scheme. Comparing to the conventional 2-D wavelet coding schemes, it produces clearly better subjective image quality.","","Contourlet transform, Wavelet-based contourlet transform, Bit-plane coding, Directional filter bank, Directional transform, Wavelet transform, Image coding, Computational complexity reduction, Adaptive Directional Transform","",""

For further improvement in the coding performance with the low computational complexity, we introduce a sampling-based intra coding method. The proposed method generates two sub-images, which are defined as a sampled sub-image and a prediction error sub-image in this paper, from an original image through horizontal or vertical sampling and prediction processes, and then each sub-image is encoded with different intra prediction modes, quantization parameters, and scanning patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the intra coding performance and reduces the encoding complexity with the smaller number of the RD cost calculation process.","","H.264/AVC, Sampling-based intra coding, Sampled sub-image, Prediction error sub-image, Intra prediction mode, Rate-distortion (RD) optimization, Intra mode decision, Video coding","",""

In IPFP, interval parameters for waste amounts and transportation/operation costs can be quantified; aspiration levels for net system costs, as well as tolerance intervals for both capacities of waste treatment facilities and waste generation rates can be reflected; and the nonlinear EOS effects transformed from objective function to constraints can be approximated. An interactive algorithm is proposed for solving the IPFP model, which in nature is an interval-parameter mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming model. To demonstrate the IPFP’s advantages, two alternative models are developed to compare their performances. One is a conventional linear-regression-based inexact fuzzy programming model (IPFP2) and the other is an IPFP model with all right-hand-sides of fussy constraints being the corresponding interval numbers (IPFP3). The comparison results between IPFP and IPFP2 indicate that the optimized waste amounts would have the similar patterns in both models. However, when dealing with EOS effects in constraints, the IPFP2 may underestimate the net system costs while the IPFP can estimate the costs more accurately. The comparison results between IPFP and IPFP3 indicate that their solutions would be significantly different. The decreased system uncertainties in IPFP’s solutions demonstrate its effectiveness for providing more satisfactory interval solutions than IPFP3. Following its first application to waste management, the IPFP can be potentially applied to other environmental problems under multiple complexities.","","Piecewise linearization, Fuzzy flexible programming, Interval nonlinear programming, Economies of scale","",""

Managers at these five levels of government need access to information to assist them to plan the land use change prior to performing on-ground activities. To this end, the suitability of 38 predominately native species in the 113,000km2 Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments (CSHC) has been mapped at a 100m resolution. In this data-sparse region, this was achieved by using a five-variable spatial overlay approach as we were able to readily access the required environmental variables and rule-set defining the species’ requirements (or tolerances). As the rules did not consider optimal growth they were possibly ‘too inclusive’, so the spatial extent of areas suggested for re-planting was refined by defining ‘target areas’ for trees, shrubs and grasses based on precipitation, aspect, landform, and slope. In the land-use planning criteria developed here we suggest that hill-slopes and gullies with slopes greater than or equal to 15° (defined from a 100m resolution DEM) be left for natural succession. Due to lateral flow of water, sediment and nutrients from these steep slope and gullies, further prioritising re-vegetation target areas to the zone adjacent to and down slope from these steep portions of the landscape reduces sediment entering the river network with a minimal decrease of regional stream flow. These two functions (mapping species suitability and locating where priority and target re-vegetation activities should be undertaken) are available at a 100m resolution for the entire CSHC by accessing a bilingual decision support tool called ReVegIH (Re-Vegetation Impacts on Hydrology). Finally, an ecohydrological model was used to simulate changes in average annual stream flow originating from the CSHC based on implementing the ‘target’ and ‘priority’ area re-vegetation activities within the constraints of two land limits.","","Ecohydrology, Scenario planning, Grain-for-Green Project, Loess Plateau, Vegetation suitability mapping, Re-vegetation, Afforestation, Land-use planning, Soil erosion, Water yield, Stream flow, Environmental management","",""

Two field studies demonstrate the mechanisms driving this effect. First, fit effects result from the interaction between reward type and presentation format (i.e., verbal vs. numerical) and affect perceived reward values and investment decisions. Second, cognitive engagement and “feeling right” about reward redemption mediate the effects of fit on investment opportunity evaluations. In turn, the findings demonstrate that CRP efficacy can be enhanced by stimulating regulatory orientations that match the presentation formats of the reward and that the dual affective–cognitive processes affect probabilistic judgments of rewards.

Finding the optimal truncation point of each wavelet-decomposed code block (CB) within each description is an NP-hard problem (Akyol et al., 2007 [1]). For P2P video streaming, it is necessary to implement an efficient multiple description encoder with three attributes; “adaptive” (due to the time-varying capacity of the P2P network links and nodes), “low-complexity” (because of the low processing power of the receiving peer) with arbitrarily “unbalanced descriptions” (because of the unequal capacities of the different sending peers). To design a multiple description encoder with the above mentioned features, we propose a simple clustering algorithm for partitioning the CBs into a limited number of clusters. This simple and efficient clustering algorithm significantly reduces the size of redundancy-rate assignment matrix, such that one can find the optimal channel-aware cluster-level redundancy-rate assignment matrix using a low-complexity full search approach. This approach improves the decoding quality compared to the co-echelon adaptive frameworks (Akyol et al., 2007 [1]; Tillo et al., 2007 [8]) in which a non-optimal heuristic rate assignment pattern is used. Especially for the unbalanced P2P scenario (which is the usual case), the performance gain of the proposed approach over the one presented in Tillo et al. (2007) [8] (generating only balanced descriptions) is significant (0.95–3.0dB). In addition, the proposed clustering approach may be analytically represented by closed-form relations for low-complexity computation of the optimal encoding parameters. Our complexity analysis shows that the proposed approach requires 52–96% less computations compared to the framework in Akyol et al. (2007) [1]. Therefore, an efficient real-time post-encoding adaptation mechanism may be realized. The simulation results demonstrate that the adaptive proposed framework outperforms the approach presented in Akyol et al. (2007) [1] by (0.26–0.95dB) and the non-adaptive multiple description coding by (1.1–2.3dB).","","Scalable video coding, Multiple description coding, Motion compensated temporal filtering, Channel-aware redundancy-rate allocation, Clustering","",""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing TEVAR, elucidating the role of surgical and pathologic variables on morbidity and mortality. Methods National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data were reviewed for all patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aorta repair from 2005 to 2007. The patients' operative indication and surgical complexity were used to divide them into study and control populations. Comorbid profiles were assessed utilizing a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Thirty-day occurrences of mortality and serious adverse events (SAEs) were used as study endpoints. Univariate and multivariate models were created using demographic and clinical variables to assess for significant differences in endpoints (P ≤ .05). Results A total of 440 patients undergoing TEVAR were identified. When evaluating patients based on operative indication, the ruptured population had increased mortality and SAE rates compared to the nonruptured DTA population (22.6% vs 6.2%;P < .01 and 35.5% vs 9.1%;P < .01, respectively). Further analysis by surgical complexity revealed increased mortality and SAE rates when comparing the brachiocephalic aortic debranching population to the noncovered left subclavian artery population (23.1% vs 6.5%; P = .02 and 30.8% vs 9.1%; P < .01, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that operative indication was not a correlate of mortality or SAEs (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; P = .92 and OR, 1.42; P = .39, respectively); however, brachiocephalic aortic debranching exhibited a deleterious effect on mortality (OR, 8.75; P < .01) and SAE rate (OR, 6.67; P = .01). Conclusion The operative indication for a TEVAR procedure was not found to be a predictor of poor patient outcome. Surgical complexity, specifically the need for brachiocephalic aortic debranching and aortoiliac conduit, was shown to influence the occurrence of SAEs in a multivariate model. Comparative data, such as these, illustrate real-world outcomes of patients undergoing TEVAR outside of the original FDA-approved indications. This information is of paramount importance to various stakeholders, including third-party payers, the device industry, regulatory agencies, surgeons, and their patients.","","","",""

The Dutch version of the program is called ‘PreCare’. The empirical analysis highlights the effects of rationalized health programs on local practices, in terms of the amount of work required, how local practices are disciplined, how these programs (re)draw boundaries, the ‘travel expenditures’ involved (and developed ‘coping strategies’), and how local practices (try to) reshape the program. Our empirical analysis builds on a combination of qualitative methods. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with 19 people involved in the PreCare program.

Furthermore, we observed at several meetings, including case conferences and management intervision meetings. The article makes a theoretical and practical contribution to the field. Theoretically, we show how the rationalization process is linked to a broader development of quantification and how both developments are based on a particularly modern ontology and epistemology in which what is considered ‘real’ and ‘knowledgeable’ becomes closely tied to what is measurable. The article offers a different conceptualization of rationalized health programs, one that acknowledges the need to standardize some elements, but also recognizes the need to be open and flexible toward local practices.

Few studies have explored patient outcomes at 12 months from enrolment in a CHF. The aim of the current study was to explore the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in four high complexity CHF-MPs at 12 months after initial enrolment. A secondary aim was to explore the adoption of key evidence-based CHF management strategies in these programmes. After ethics approval, a multisite mixed methods design was implemented incorporating survey and chart audit. Programme characteristics and interventions used in four CHF-MPs were surveyed in Stage 1. Stage 2 involved a chart audit of patients enrolled in the programmes (N=135) on or after the 1/1/07. Primary endpoints were all-cause hospitalisation and/or mortality at 12 months. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. All programmes implemented a high complexity of evidence-based interventions consistent with national guidelines. However, documentation of New York Heart Association functional class was rare; limiting quantifiable evaluation of response to therapy throughout programme enrolment. The majority of patients (73%) had severe systolic heart failure with high co-morbidities reflected in a mean Charlson's total co-morbidity score of 3 (±2.1). The high rate of baseline evidence-based, pharmacotherapy (beta-blocker: 86%, n=112 and ACE inhibitor: 76%, n=103) was maintained at 12 months (71% and 84% respectively). At 12 months all cause hospitalisation and/or mortality was 57% (n=77). The CHF-MPs in this study implemented complex evidence-based interventions resulting in high rates of key medication prescription. However, despite the implementation of several evidence-based interventions, over a period of 12 months, more than half of the patients were rehospitalised or died.","","Heart failure management programmes, Chronic heart failure, Evidence-based interventions, Complexity","",""

Here, a novel method for proximal remote detection of plant light tolerance is investigated. The method is based on an identification of a transfer function model for the measured chlorophyll fluorescence response to a small step variation in blue LED light. It is postulated that the least required model order decreases as the plants become light stressed due to saturation effects at excess light conditions. We apply this method to basil and lettuce plants under different background light intensities, and the results are compared to measured effective quantum yield (y(II)), relative electron transport rate through PSII (ETR(II)) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), all reflecting the photosynthetic performance. For both species it is indeed found that the required model order decreases with increasing background light intensity at the same time as the measured reference parameters indicates a decreased photosynthetic efficiency. It is suggested that the light intensity should be such that the chlorophyll fluorescence response requires a model order of 3 or higher to avoid ineffective irradiation of the plants.","","Photosynthesis, fluorescence, plant sensing, step function responses, dynamic behaviour, system identification, method development, feedback control","",""

When only vertices out of the code are asked to be identified, we get the related concept of a locating-dominating set. These notions are closely related to a number of similar and well-studied concepts such as the one of a test cover. In this paper, we study the decision problems Identifying Code and Locating-Dominating Set (which consist in deciding whether a given graph admits an identifying code or a locating-dominating set, respectively, with a given size) and their minimization variants Minimum Identifying Code and Minimum Locating-Dominating Set. These problems are known to be NP-hard, even when the input graph belongs to a number of specific graph classes such as planar bipartite graphs. Moreover, it is known that they are approximable within a logarithmic factor, but hard to approximate within any sub-logarithmic factor. We extend the latter result to the case where the input graph is bipartite, split or co-bipartite: both problems remain hard in these cases. Among other results, we also show that for bipartite graphs of bounded maximum degree (at least 3), the two problems are hard to approximate within some constant factor, a question which was open. We summarize all known results in the area, and we compare them to the ones for the related problem Dominating Set. In particular, our work exhibits important graph classes for which Dominating Set is efficiently solvable, but Identifying Code and Locating-Dominating Set are hard (whereas in all previous works, their complexity was the same). We also introduce graph classes for which the converse holds, and for which the complexities of Identifying Code and Locating-Dominating Set differ.","","Test cover, Separating system, Identifying code, Locating-dominating set, NP-completeness, Approximation","",""

Some emerging applications such as video surveillance, visual sensor networks, and remote space transmission require scalable coding solutions, which are not only compression efficient but also provide low encoding complexity and high error resilience. Following the call for scalable extensions of the emerging High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, targeting the so-called Scalable HEVC (SHVC) standard, this paper proposes a novel scalable video coding solution offering quality scalability by combining the predictive and distributed video coding approaches by means of an HEVC compliant base layer and distributed coding enhancement layers. The proposed Distributed Scalable Video Coding (DSVC) solution follows an Intra-encoding with Inter-decoding approach to provide low encoding complexity and error robustness while achieving high compression. Towards this objective, this paper adopts a novel coding architecture and proposes several novel enhancement layers coding tools, notably for side information creation, correlation modeling, and coding mode selection. The experimental results reveal that the DSVC RD performance outperforms the relevant alternative coding solutions, notably by up to 33.22% and 11.28% BD-Rate gains regarding the relevant HEVC-Simulcast and SHVC-Intra-benchmarks, while achieving a lower encoding complexity.","","Scalable video coding, Distributed video coding, HEVC standard, Quality scalability, Side information creation, Correlation modeling","",""

Most of the computational burden comes from uni-directional and bi-directional prediction. In this paper, an iterative search strategy is designed to speed up the uni-directional prediction in MVC. It can work with an adaptive search range adjustment through a confidence measure of a loop constraint to obtain both motion and disparity vectors jointly. Furthermore, a selective bi-directional prediction algorithm is proposed to enhance the coding performance by analyzing the statistical characteristics of bi-directional prediction in MVC.

Students were tested in grades 3 and 4. Structural equation modeling was used to examine cross-language transfer in a cross-lagged panel design. Results showed moderate cross-language paths when controlling for autoregressive effects. These findings are in line with previous results showing reciprocal transfer effects between L1 and L2 reading comprehension and reading fluency. In addition, the overall dominance of paths from L2 to L1 over paths from L1 to L2 suggests immersion-specific relations that may be attributable to the plentiful opportunities for academic reading in the L2 at school.
