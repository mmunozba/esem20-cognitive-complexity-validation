abstract = "Objective
To describe the characteristics of hospitalizations for patients who use clinical programs that provide care coordination for children with multiple, chronic medical conditions.
Study design
Retrospective analysis of 1083 patients hospitalized between June 2006 and July 2008 who used a structured, pediatric complex-care clinical program within 4 children’s hospitals. Chronic diagnosis prevalence (ie, technology assistance, neurologic impairment, and other complex chronic conditions), inpatient resource utilization (ie, length of stay, 30-day readmission), and reasons for hospitalization were assessed across the programs.
Results
Over the 2-year study period, complex-care program patients experienced a mean of 3.1 ± 2.8 admissions, a mean length of hospital stay per admission of 12.2 ± 25.5 days, and a 30-day hospital readmission rate of 25.4%. Neurologic impairment (57%) and presence of a gastrostomy tube (56%) were the most common clinical characteristics of program patients. Notable reasons for admission included major surgery (47.1%), medical technology malfunction (9.0%), seizure (6.4%), aspiration pneumonia (3.9%), vomiting/feeding difficulties (3.4%), and asthma (1.8%).
Conclusions
Hospitalized patients who used a structured clinical program for children with medical complexity experienced lengthy hospitalizations with high early readmission rates. Reducing hospital readmission may be one potential strategy for decreasing inpatient expenditures in this group of children with high resource utilization."

By applying Regulatory Fit theory, to understand how to sustain goal orientation (promotion or prevention) and stimulate task engagement through a match with the manner of goal pursuit, this study demonstrates that the presentation style suppliers adopt influences resellers' perceptions of reward value and their rate of point redemption with respect to CRPs. Two field studies demonstrate the mechanisms driving this effect. First, fit effects result from the interaction between reward type and presentation format (i.e., verbal vs. numerical) and affect perceived reward values and investment decisions. Second, cognitive engagement and “feeling right” about reward redemption mediate the effects of fit on investment opportunity evaluations. In turn, the findings demonstrate that CRP efficacy can be enhanced by stimulating regulatory orientations that match the presentation formats of the reward and that the dual affective–cognitive processes affect probabilistic judgments of rewards. This additional mechanism can further stimulate resellers' engagement with and investment in CRPs within complex decision-making contexts."

Study design
Mailed survey to families of CMC enrolled in a structured-care program providing care coordination and oversight at 1 of 3 children's hospitals. Outcomes included receipt of 14 specific health service needs. Paired t tests compared unmet health care needs prior to and following program enrollment.
Results
Four hundred forty-one of 968 (46%) surveys were returned and analyzed. Respondents reported their children had a mean age of 7 (SD 5) years. A majority of respondents reported the child had developmental delay (79%) and feeding difficulties (64%). Of the respondents, 56% regarded the primary care provider as the primary point of contact for medical issues. Respondents reported an increase in meeting all 14 health services needs after enrollment in a tertiary care center-based structured clinical program, including primary care checkups (82% vs 96%), therapies (78% vs 91%), mental health care (34% vs 58%), respite care (56% vs 75%), and referrals (51% vs 83%) (all P < .001).

The study was longitudinal and qualitative based on interviews with nursing students, six women and two men aged 20–36, during their three years of education. In all, seven patterns were found embracing aspects of importance for the students' learning: Having a clear goal, being able to re-evaluate one's ideas, being acknowledged, when the abstract becomes tangible, using one's own experiences as a tool for learning, hovering between closeness and distance regarding one's future profession and handling theory and practice in relation to one another. The results show the importance of providing clinical courses, strongly connected to the theoretical parts of the program and to use reflection and experience-based learning in the nursing program."

The controllability of LED lighting systems for greenhouses and plant factories offers a possibility for light induced diagnose of plant status. Here, a novel method for proximal remote detection of plant light tolerance is investigated. The method is based on an identification of a transfer function model for the measured chlorophyll fluorescence response to a small step variation in blue LED light. It is postulated that the least required model order decreases as the plants become light stressed due to saturation effects at excess light conditions. We apply this method to basil and lettuce plants under different background light intensities, and the results are compared to measured effective quantum yield (y(II)), relative electron transport rate through PSII (ETR(II)) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), all reflecting the photosynthetic performance. For both species it is indeed found that the required model order decreases with increasing background light intensity at the same time as the measured reference parameters indicates a decreased photosynthetic efficiency. It is suggested that the light intensity should be such that the chlorophyll fluorescence response requires a model order of 3 or higher to avoid ineffective irradiation of the plants."

abstract = "Introduction
Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) devices are increasingly being utilized to treat aortic pathologies outside of the original Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approval for nonruptured descending thoracic aorta aneurysms (DTAs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing TEVAR, elucidating the role of surgical and pathologic variables on morbidity and mortality.
Methods
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data were reviewed for all patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aorta repair from 2005 to 2007. The patients' operative indication and surgical complexity were used to divide them into study and control populations. Comorbid profiles were assessed utilizing a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Thirty-day occurrences of mortality and serious adverse events (SAEs) were used as study endpoints. Univariate and multivariate models were created using demographic and clinical variables to assess for significant differences in endpoints (P ≤ .05).
Results
A total of 440 patients undergoing TEVAR were identified. When evaluating patients based on operative indication, the ruptured population had increased mortality and SAE rates compared to the nonruptured DTA population (22.6% vs 6.2%;P < .01 and 35.5% vs 9.1%;P < .01, respectively). Further analysis by surgical complexity revealed increased mortality and SAE rates when comparing the brachiocephalic aortic debranching population to the noncovered left subclavian artery population (23.1% vs 6.5%; P = .02 and 30.8% vs 9.1%; P < .01, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that operative indication was not a correlate of mortality or SAEs (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; P = .92 and OR, 1.42; P = .39, respectively); however, brachiocephalic aortic debranching exhibited a deleterious effect on mortality (OR, 8.75; P < .01) and SAE rate (OR, 6.67; P = .01).
Conclusion
The operative indication for a TEVAR procedure was not found to be a predictor of poor patient outcome. Surgical complexity, specifically the need for brachiocephalic aortic debranching and aortoiliac conduit, was shown to influence the occurrence of SAEs in a multivariate model. Comparative data, such as these, illustrate real-world outcomes of patients undergoing TEVAR outside of the original FDA-approved indications. This information is of paramount importance to various stakeholders, including third-party payers, the device industry, regulatory agencies, surgeons, and their patients."

For safety and control purposes it is of interest to equip every single cell with an Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurement system. However, performing EIS measurements simultaneously on each cell in a battery pack introduces crosstalk interferences in surrounding cells. This causes EIS measurements in battery packs to be inaccurate. An experimental investigation on a battery pack showed that crosstalk is a linear phenomenon which is dependent on the measurement frequency, the relative position of the cells and the inter-cell spacing. Based on the experimental results and a proposed two-coil model with inductive coupling, a transfer-function description has been developed in order to simulate the crosstalk behavior. This model can be used as a supporting tool in the development of ElS-based measurement systems in battery packs."

Managers at these five levels of government need access to information to assist them to plan the land use change prior to performing on-ground activities. To this end, the suitability of 38 predominately native species in the 113,000km2 Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments (CSHC) has been mapped at a 100m resolution. In this data-sparse region, this was achieved by using a five-variable spatial overlay approach as we were able to readily access the required environmental variables and rule-set defining the species’ requirements (or tolerances). As the rules did not consider optimal growth they were possibly ‘too inclusive’, so the spatial extent of areas suggested for re-planting was refined by defining ‘target areas’ for trees, shrubs and grasses based on precipitation, aspect, landform, and slope. In the land-use planning criteria developed here we suggest that hill-slopes and gullies with slopes greater than or equal to 15° (defined from a 100m resolution DEM) be left for natural succession. Due to lateral flow of water, sediment and nutrients from these steep slope and gullies, further prioritising re-vegetation target areas to the zone adjacent to and down slope from these steep portions of the landscape reduces sediment entering the river network with a minimal decrease of regional stream flow. These two functions (mapping species suitability and locating where priority and target re-vegetation activities should be undertaken) are available at a 100m resolution for the entire CSHC by accessing a bilingual decision support tool called ReVegIH (Re-Vegetation Impacts on Hydrology). Finally, an ecohydrological model was used to simulate changes in average annual stream flow originating from the CSHC based on implementing the ‘target’ and ‘priority’ area re-vegetation activities within the constraints of two land limits."

By integrating the respective characteristics of compressive sensing and distributed source coding, we propose a novel multi-view video coding approach for use in resource limited devices such as wireless video sensor networks. The proposed approach can explore the sparsity of video images, allow for low complexity encoder and the exploitation of inter-camera correlation without communications among cameras.

In IPFP, interval parameters for waste amounts and transportation/operation costs can be quantified; aspiration levels for net system costs, as well as tolerance intervals for both capacities of waste treatment facilities and waste generation rates can be reflected; and the nonlinear EOS effects transformed from objective function to constraints can be approximated. An interactive algorithm is proposed for solving the IPFP model, which in nature is an interval-parameter mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming model. To demonstrate the IPFP’s advantages, two alternative models are developed to compare their performances. One is a conventional linear-regression-based inexact fuzzy programming model (IPFP2) and the other is an IPFP model with all right-hand-sides of fussy constraints being the corresponding interval numbers (IPFP3). The comparison results between IPFP and IPFP2 indicate that the optimized waste amounts would have the similar patterns in both models. However, when dealing with EOS effects in constraints, the IPFP2 may underestimate the net system costs while the IPFP can estimate the costs more accurately. The comparison results between IPFP and IPFP3 indicate that their solutions would be significantly different. The decreased system uncertainties in IPFP’s solutions demonstrate its effectiveness for providing more satisfactory interval solutions than IPFP3. Following its first application to waste management, the IPFP can be potentially applied to other environmental problems under multiple complexities."

Most of the computational burden comes from uni-directional and bi-directional prediction. In this paper, an iterative search strategy is designed to speed up the uni-directional prediction in MVC. It can work with an adaptive search range adjustment through a confidence measure of a loop constraint to obtain both motion and disparity vectors jointly. Furthermore, a selective bi-directional prediction algorithm is proposed to enhance the coding performance by analyzing the statistical characteristics of bi-directional prediction in MVC. Experimental results demonstrate that, by using the proposed fast search, the temporal and inter-view redundancies of multiview video can be eliminated sufficiently with low complexity."

First, we propose short-length 2-D filters for directional transform. Second, the directional transform is applied to only a few selected subbands and the selection is done by a mean-shift-based decision procedure. Third, we fine-tune the context tables used by the arithmetic coder in WBCT coding to improve coding efficiency and to reduce computation. Simulations show that, at comparable coded image quality, the proposed scheme saves over 92% computing time of the original WBCT scheme. Comparing to the conventional 2-D wavelet coding schemes, it produces clearly better subjective image quality."

abstract = "This article aims to understand the effects of rationalized health programs (the basic components of which are efficiency, calculability, predictability and control) on local practices. We discuss how a successful U.S. intervention in preventive youth health care (the Nurse Family Partnership) has been translated and adapted within a Dutch setting. The Dutch version of the program is called ‘PreCare’. The empirical analysis highlights the effects of rationalized health programs on local practices, in terms of the amount of work required, how local practices are disciplined, how these programs (re)draw boundaries, the ‘travel expenditures’ involved (and developed ‘coping strategies’), and how local practices (try to) reshape the program. Our empirical analysis builds on a combination of qualitative methods. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with 19 people involved in the PreCare program. The majority of the interviews were conducted between July and November 2008. We also conducted an analysis of relevant documents related to the PreCare intervention and protocol. Furthermore, we observed at several meetings, including case conferences and management intervision meetings. The article makes a theoretical and practical contribution to the field. Theoretically, we show how the rationalization process is linked to a broader development of quantification and how both developments are based on a particularly modern ontology and epistemology in which what is considered ‘real’ and ‘knowledgeable’ becomes closely tied to what is measurable. The article offers a different conceptualization of rationalized health programs, one that acknowledges the need to standardize some elements, but also recognizes the need to be open and flexible toward local practices. We specifically focus on the tools that are able to deal with both the need to standardize and the need to be open toward local practices. We suggest that ‘(re)writing devices’ are a fruitful category of tools for this purpose."

abstract = "Multiple description scalable coding based on T+2D wavelet decomposition structure is highly flexible for peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming. Finding the optimal truncation point of each wavelet-decomposed code block (CB) within each description is an NP-hard problem (Akyol et al., 2007 [1]). For P2P video streaming, it is necessary to implement an efficient multiple description encoder with three attributes; “adaptive” (due to the time-varying capacity of the P2P network links and nodes), “low-complexity” (because of the low processing power of the receiving peer) with arbitrarily “unbalanced descriptions” (because of the unequal capacities of the different sending peers). To design a multiple description encoder with the above mentioned features, we propose a simple clustering algorithm for partitioning the CBs into a limited number of clusters. This simple and efficient clustering algorithm significantly reduces the size of redundancy-rate assignment matrix, such that one can find the optimal channel-aware cluster-level redundancy-rate assignment matrix using a low-complexity full search approach. This approach improves the decoding quality compared to the co-echelon adaptive frameworks (Akyol et al., 2007 [1]; Tillo et al., 2007 [8]) in which a non-optimal heuristic rate assignment pattern is used. Especially for the unbalanced P2P scenario (which is the usual case), the performance gain of the proposed approach over the one presented in Tillo et al. (2007) [8] (generating only balanced descriptions) is significant (0.95–3.0dB). In addition, the proposed clustering approach may be analytically represented by closed-form relations for low-complexity computation of the optimal encoding parameters. Our complexity analysis shows that the proposed approach requires 52–96% less computations compared to the framework in Akyol et al. (2007) [1]. Therefore, an efficient real-time post-encoding adaptation mechanism may be realized. The simulation results demonstrate that the adaptive proposed framework outperforms the approach presented in Akyol et al. (2007) [1] by (0.26–0.95dB) and the non-adaptive multiple description coding by (1.1–2.3dB)."

We have called these codes FRLR STFBCs with interleaving (FRLR STFBCs-I). FRLR STFBCs-I could achieve a full-diversity property over quasi-static channels. Simulation results also verify that the proposed schemes exhibit proper performances in comparison with the recently proposed STFBCs. The most outstanding characteristic of the newly introduced high-rate codes is the linear complexity of the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver which makes possible a fast and economical decoding process."

Chronic heart failure management programmes (CHF-MPs) have been developed to improve, clinical outcomes in response to the high burden of disease from chronic heart failure (CHF). Programmes vary in model, duration, complexity of interventions and incorporation of evidence-based guidelines for programme delivery. Few studies have explored patient outcomes at 12 months from enrolment in a CHF. The aim of the current study was to explore the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in four high complexity CHF-MPs at 12 months after initial enrolment. A secondary aim was to explore the adoption of key evidence-based CHF management strategies in these programmes. After ethics approval, a multisite mixed methods design was implemented incorporating survey and chart audit. Programme characteristics and interventions used in four CHF-MPs were surveyed in Stage 1. Stage 2 involved a chart audit of patients enrolled in the programmes (N=135) on or after the 1/1/07. Primary endpoints were all-cause hospitalisation and/or mortality at 12 months. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. All programmes implemented a high complexity of evidence-based interventions consistent with national guidelines. However, documentation of New York Heart Association functional class was rare; limiting quantifiable evaluation of response to therapy throughout programme enrolment. The majority of patients (73%) had severe systolic heart failure with high co-morbidities reflected in a mean Charlson's total co-morbidity score of 3 (±2.1). The high rate of baseline evidence-based, pharmacotherapy (beta-blocker: 86%, n=112 and ACE inhibitor: 76%, n=103) was maintained at 12 months (71% and 84% respectively). At 12 months all cause hospitalisation and/or mortality was 57% (n=77). The CHF-MPs in this study implemented complex evidence-based interventions resulting in high rates of key medication prescription. However, despite the implementation of several evidence-based interventions, over a period of 12 months, more than half of the patients were rehospitalised or died."

Our work advances the testing of the dating method through the systematic use of replicates and explores the methodological implications of dating very small samples (10–40 μg carbon). Thirty-six radiocarbon age determinations range from 3000 years ago to Modern. The results contribute to an understanding of art production in the Australian arid zone during a period of extreme cultural dynamism. We have demonstrated for the first time that significant late Holocene changes in discard rates of artefacts and technological organization of the extractive technologies of implements such seed-grinders is matched by a very high level of stylistic heterogeneity in the art – which has been systematically dated within and between dialect groups."

Improved access to surgical care could prevent a significant burden of disease and disability-adjusted life years, and workforce shortages are the biggest obstacle to surgical care. To address this shortage, a 5-year surgical residency program was established at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in July 2009. As the residency enters its fourth year, we hypothesized that the initiation of a general surgical residency program would result in an increase in the overall case volume and complexity at KCH.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective analysis of operated cases at KCH during the 3 years before and the third year after the implementation of the KCH surgical residency program, from July 2006 to July 2009 and the calendar year 2012, respectively.
Results
During the 3 years before the initiation of the surgical residency, an average of 2317 operations were performed per year, whereas in 2012, 2773 operations were performed, representing a 20% increase. Before residency, an average of 1191 major operations per year were performed, and in 2012, 1501 major operations were performed, representing a 26% increase.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that operative case volume and complexity increase following the initiation of a surgical residency program in a sub-Saharan tertiary hospital. We believe that by building on established partnerships and emphasizing education, research, and clinical care, we can start to tackle the issues of surgical access and care."

Although there is an extensive literature on cross-language effects on reading in general, research focusing on immersion students and including different dimensions of reading acquisition such as reading fluency and reading comprehension is scarce. This study therefore investigated cross-language transfer between first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) reading fluency and reading comprehension in a group of 220 German elementary school students who were enrolled in English partial immersion programs. Students were tested in grades 3 and 4. Structural equation modeling was used to examine cross-language transfer in a cross-lagged panel design. Results showed moderate cross-language paths when controlling for autoregressive effects. These findings are in line with previous results showing reciprocal transfer effects between L1 and L2 reading comprehension and reading fluency. In addition, the overall dominance of paths from L2 to L1 over paths from L1 to L2 suggests immersion-specific relations that may be attributable to the plentiful opportunities for academic reading in the L2 at school. Hence, skills necessary for successful reading can evidently be acquired in an L2 context and transferred to the L1. These findings underline the importance of cross-language transfer between reading skills in immersion programs."

For further improvement in the coding performance with the low computational complexity, we introduce a sampling-based intra coding method. The proposed method generates two sub-images, which are defined as a sampled sub-image and a prediction error sub-image in this paper, from an original image through horizontal or vertical sampling and prediction processes, and then each sub-image is encoded with different intra prediction modes, quantization parameters, and scanning patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the intra coding performance and reduces the encoding complexity with the smaller number of the RD cost calculation process."

We aim toward creation of a pipeline for automated closed-loop identification of dynamic models of synthetically engineered genetic circuits in microorganisms. As a step towards this aim, we here study modelling of the input-output behaviour of the yGIL337 strain of S. cerevisiae. In this strain expression of the fluorescent reporter can be turned on by growing the yeast in galactose and off by glucose. We perform parameter estimation on a system of three ordinary differential equations of Michaelis-Menten type based on in vivo data from a microfluidic experiment by Fiore et al. (2013) after redoing the data preprocessing. The parameter estimation is done using AMIGO2–a state of the art Matlab toolbox for iterative identification of dynamical models.

Then new thoughts of project and program management in the space of complexity of the project industry are proposed as the first step to build a new management paradigm, which has been qualitatively induced by the cases under study and are deriving from existing research results on complex projects.

When only vertices out of the code are asked to be identified, we get the related concept of a locating-dominating set. These notions are closely related to a number of similar and well-studied concepts such as the one of a test cover. In this paper, we study the decision problems Identifying Code and Locating-Dominating Set (which consist in deciding whether a given graph admits an identifying code or a locating-dominating set, respectively, with a given size) and their minimization variants Minimum Identifying Code and Minimum Locating-Dominating Set. These problems are known to be NP-hard, even when the input graph belongs to a number of specific graph classes such as planar bipartite graphs. Moreover, it is known that they are approximable within a logarithmic factor, but hard to approximate within any sub-logarithmic factor. We extend the latter result to the case where the input graph is bipartite, split or co-bipartite: both problems remain hard in these cases. Among other results, we also show that for bipartite graphs of bounded maximum degree (at least 3), the two problems are hard to approximate within some constant factor, a question which was open. We summarize all known results in the area, and we compare them to the ones for the related problem Dominating Set. In particular, our work exhibits important graph classes for which Dominating Set is efficiently solvable, but Identifying Code and Locating-Dominating Set are hard (whereas in all previous works, their complexity was the same). We also introduce graph classes for which the converse holds, and for which the complexities of Identifying Code and Locating-Dominating Set differ."

abstract = "Background
developing a student׳s sense of capability, purpose, resourcefulness, identity and connectedness (five-senses of success) are key factors that may be important in predicting student satisfaction and progression within their university program.
Aim
the study aimed to examine the expectations and experiences of second and third year midwifery students enroled in a Bachelor of Midwifery program and identify barriers and enablers to success.
Method
a descriptive exploratory qualitative design was used. Fifty-six students enroled in either year 2 or 3 of the Bachelor of Midwifery program in SE Queensland participated in an anonymous survey using open-ended questions. In addition, 16 students participated in two year-level focus groups. Template analysis, using the Five Senses Framework, was used to analyse the data set.
Findings
early exposure to ‘hands on’ clinical midwifery practice as well as continuity of care experiences provided students with an opportunity to link theory to practice and increased their perception of capability as they transitioned through the program. Student׳s sense of identity, purpose, resourcefulness, and capability was strongly influenced by the programs embedded meta-values, including a ‘woman centred’ approach. In addition, a student׳s ability to form strong positive relationships with women, peers, lecturers and supportive clinicians was central to developing connections and ultimately a sense of success. A sense of connection not only fostered an ongoing belief that challenges could be overcome but that students׳ themselves could initiate or influence change.
Conclusions
the five senses framework provided a useful lens through which to analyse the student experience. Key factors to student satisfaction and retention within a Bachelor of Midwifery program include: a clearly articulated midwifery philosophy, strategies to promote student connectedness including the use of social media, and further development of clinician׳s skills in preceptorship, clinical teaching and facilitation. Program delivery methods and student support systems should be designed to enable maximum flexibility to promote capability and resourcefulness and embed sense of purpose and identity early in the program."

abstract = "The growing heterogeneity and dynamic nature of the networks, terminals, and usage environments has boosted the need for powerful scalable video coding engines able to efficiently adapt to changing consumption conditions. Some emerging applications such as video surveillance, visual sensor networks, and remote space transmission require scalable coding solutions, which are not only compression efficient but also provide low encoding complexity and high error resilience. Following the call for scalable extensions of the emerging High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, targeting the so-called Scalable HEVC (SHVC) standard, this paper proposes a novel scalable video coding solution offering quality scalability by combining the predictive and distributed video coding approaches by means of an HEVC compliant base layer and distributed coding enhancement layers. The proposed Distributed Scalable Video Coding (DSVC) solution follows an Intra-encoding with Inter-decoding approach to provide low encoding complexity and error robustness while achieving high compression. Towards this objective, this paper adopts a novel coding architecture and proposes several novel enhancement layers coding tools, notably for side information creation, correlation modeling, and coding mode selection. The experimental results reveal that the DSVC RD performance outperforms the relevant alternative coding solutions, notably by up to 33.22% and 11.28% BD-Rate gains regarding the relevant HEVC-Simulcast and SHVC-Intra-benchmarks, while achieving a lower encoding complexity."

abstract = "Current literature on open government data has uncovered a wide range of challenges related to these important initiatives. The problems encountered include: insufficient data quality and interoperability, problems regarding governance and motivation, lack of capabilities, and heterogeneous political and ideological agendas. A common open data infrastructure might resolve some of these problems, however, implementing such an infrastructure is a highly complex task. This longitudinal case study of the Danish Basic Data Program (BDP) is intended to improve our understanding of the challenges related to providing open access to government data through open data infrastructure. The BDP aims to improve the quality of selected government data, make them more coherent, and improve accessibility through the implementation of a common data distribution platform. The program is expected to increase government efficiency and stimulate innovation. This case study describes the evolution of the BDP and identifies the main structural elements of an open data infrastructure. Data analysis uncovered four tensions, which are identified as key challenges of an open data infrastructure implementation. These tensions are presented with four suggested governance strategies that were used in the BDP case. The main contribution of the paper is a process model where the main phases and mechanisms of an open data infrastructure implementation, use and impacts are identified and explained."
